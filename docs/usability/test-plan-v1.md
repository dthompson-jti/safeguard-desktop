# Usability Evaluation Plan: Safeguard Desktop Enhanced

## 1. Goals & Objectives
Evaluate the usability of the new Safeguard Desktop UI with key stakeholders, focusing on navigation, status clarity, and specific operational workflows.

**Primary Learning Goals:**
- **Navigation & Clarity**: Can users efficiently navigate the facility hierarchy and interpret resident status?
- **Workflow Validation**: Are commenting, searching, and filtering tasks intuitive?
- **Side Panel Interaction**: Does the "Preview Pane" model and the placement of actions within it meet user expectations?
- **Terminology Confirmation**: Do the new merged status labels and phrasing resonate with operational users?

## 2. Methodology & Setup
- **Initial State**: Historical View, Northwood JDC.
- **Method**: Remote, Moderated 1-on-1 Sessions (45 mins).
- **Target Participants**: Facility Supervisors / Senior Officers.

## 3. Moderator's Introduction Script
"Hi [Participant Name], thank you for your time. Today we're testing the Safeguard Desktop experience.

There are no right or wrong answers—we're testing the system, not you. Please 'think aloud' as much as possible. Tell me what you're looking at, what you expect to happen, and if anything feels counter-intuitive. 


## 4. Scenarios & Tasks

### Part 1: Historical View & Commenting
**Scenario**: "You are starting in the Historical View for Northwood JDC. You need to review specifically the Cedar and Maple wings."
- **Task**: 1. Locate the **Cedar** and **Maple** wings in the navigation. 2. Add a review to the checks associated with these wings.

### Part 2: Live View & Risk Assessment
**Scenario**: "Switch over to the Live Monitor to see what's happening right now."
- **Task**: 1. Navigate to the **Live View**. 2. Identify which residents are currently on **Suicide Risk**.
- **Observe / Ask**: Is risk status immediately clear? Is there any ambiguity regarding *who* is at risk?

### Part 3: Resident Details & Side Panel Interaction
**Scenario**: "You need more information about a specific resident's recent activity."
- **Task**: Find where you should click to get more information about a specific resident.
- **Observe / Ask**: Before clicking, what do you expect links in the details panel to do? How do you feel about links/actions living *only* in the side panel vs. the main UI? Any layout issues?

### Part 4: Search & Specific Retrieval
**Scenario**: "You need to find the record for a specific resident."
- **Task**: Locate checks specifically for the user **"Hattie Daniel."**
- **Observation Points**: Do they use search or scroll? Is the presentation of results clear?

### Part 5: Advanced Filtering & Editing
**Scenario**: "You want to audit the work already done."
- **Task**: 1. Filter the view to show only checks that have been **reviewed**. 2. Select an item and edit the existing review.
- **Observation Points**: Usability of "Advanced Search". Ease of editing an existing record.

### Part 6: Terminology & Status Validation (Discussion)
**Topic**: The merged status label: **"Missed – not reviewed"** (merging "Missed" and "Reviewed" logic).
- **Questions**: Does this phrasing make sense? Is the distinction between a "missed check" and a "commented check" preserved clearly enough?

## 5. UI Preference & Wrap-up
- **Placement**: "Do you prefer having detailed actions like 'View Resident' in the side panel or directly in the table row?"
- **Scannability**: "How easy was it to distinguish between SR and MW residents in the Live View?"
- **Overall Rating**: "On a scale of 1-5, how intuitive does this flow feel compared to your current process?"

"Thank you! Your feedback will directly influence the final design."
