# Explore UX

Explore interaction patterns with user-first mindset.

## Socratic Gate
If request is vague, ask first:
- Who is the user?
- What's their goal?
- What context (device, urgency)?

## Approach

### Phase 1: User Context
- User identity and goal
- Mental model expectations
- Device/context constraints

### Phase 2: Flow Options
Generate **3-4 interaction patterns** considering:
- Steps/clicks to complete
- Cognitive load
- Discoverability
- Reversibility
- Accessibility (keyboard, screen reader)

### Phase 3: Compare
**Flow Comparison**:
- **Flow A** — Steps: [#], Cognitive Load: Low/Med/High, Discoverability: Low/Med/High, Accessible: ✓/✗
- **Flow B** — Steps: [#], Cognitive Load: Low/Med/High, Discoverability: Low/Med/High, Accessible: ✓/✗

### Phase 4: Recommend
Primary flow with edge cases and accessibility requirements.

## Reflexion
Before delivering:
- Would first-time user understand?
- Most common action most prominent?
- Error recovery possible?

## Assumptions
Document: `## Assumptions` with user knowledge assumed.

## Constraints
- No technical architecture (that's `exploring-tech`)
- No visual design (that's `exploring-ui-design`)

## Output
Discussion document ending with: "Does this match expected user interaction?"
