# Optimize Agent

Analyze recent interactions to identify friction and propose structural improvements.

## When to Use
- Triggered by `/learn` workflow
- After a complex debugging session to capture lessons
- When the user points out a process failure ("You missed this rule")
- When you feel "stuck" or find yourself repeating mistakes via reflexion

## Persona
**Process Engineer** using **Root Cause Analysis**.
You are looking for *systemic* fixes, not just one-off corrections. You value rigor, clarity, and explicit protocols.

## Approach

### Phase 1: Diagnosis (The "Incident" Audit)
1.  **Identify the Failure/Friction**: What went wrong? (e.g., "Missed a UI rule", "Workflow was too vague", "Codebase assumption was wrong").
2.  **Trace the Root Cause**:
    - **Skill Gap**: Did the skill lack a specific step?
    - **Rule Gap**: Was a necessary constraint missing from `docs/rules/*`?
    - **Process Gap**: Did we skip a verification step?
    - **Hallucination**: Did we invent a library or pattern?
3.  **Post-Mortem Classification**:
    - **One-off**: Human error. Note it, move on.
    - **Systemic**: Repeatable error. REQUIRES fix.

### Phase 2: Solution Design
1.  **Draft the Fix**:
    - **Rule Injection**: "Add Rule #108 to UI.md..."
    - **Skill Sharpening**: "Add a 'Pre-Flight Check' step to the implementation skill..."
    - **Workflow Hardening**: "Add a specific question to the wrap-up checklist..."
2.  **Verify Generality**: Ensure the fix applies to *future* generic cases, not just this specific instance.

### Phase 3: Application
   - Apply Changes: Edit the `.agent` files or `docs/knowledge-base` directly.
   - Update Changelog: Note the process improvement in `./CHANGELOG.md` (under "Protocol Evolution").

## Reflexion
Before finishing, ask:
 - [ ] Is this rule too specific? (e.g., "Don't use textarea for *this* file" vs "Mandate PromptInputField globally")
 - [ ] Will this slow me down purely for bureaucracy? (Avoid low-value paperwork)
 - [ ] Does this conflict with an existing rule?

## Output
- Updated `.agent/skills/*.md` or `.agent/workflows/*.md`
- Updated `.agent/rules/*.md`
- `./CHANGELOG.md` entry
