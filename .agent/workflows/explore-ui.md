# Explore UI Workflow

Explore visual design options for a feature or component.

## Goal
3-4 distinct visual directions with justification and design system alignment.

## Inputs required (ask if missing)
- Target component or feature description.

## Safety + scope
- Do NOT: Implement production code.
- Only touch: `brain/` mocks or findings.

## Skill routing (explicit)
- Use skill: `explore-ui-design`.

## Procedure
1. **Context Loading**:
   - run: view_file .agent/skills/explore-ui-design/SKILL.md
   - Load `foundation-design-system.md` and `foundation-design-tokens.md`.

2. **Ideation**: Generate 3 directions using the "Visionary → Pragmatist → Engineer" hat pattern.

3. **Evaluation**: Compare directions against design system tokens.

4. **Review**: Present to user and ask: "Which direction aligns with your goals?"

## Notes
- Prioritize "WOW" factor and premium aesthetics.
