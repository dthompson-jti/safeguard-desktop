# Explore UX Workflow

Explore user-facing application flows and interaction patterns.

## Goal
A documented user journey with clear transition logic and state transitions.

## Inputs required (ask if missing)
- User persona or objective (e.g., "Developer wants to debug a skill").

## Safety + scope
- Do NOT: Implement UI components.

## Skill routing (explicit)
- Use skill: `explore-ux`.

## Procedure
1. **Reconnaissance**:
   - run: view_file .agent/skills/explore-ux/SKILL.md
   - View existing interaction patterns in `.agent/rules/pattern-navigation.md`.

2. **Mapping**: Document the step-by-step journey from trigger to completion.

3. **Reflexion**: Identify friction points and propose alternatives.

## Notes
- Focus on "Interaction Rigor" and accessibility.
