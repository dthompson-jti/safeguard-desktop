# React Flow Workflow

Create or refine a React Flow diagram.

## Goal
A high-rigor React Flow diagram following the V8 Geometric Strategy.

## Skill routing (explicit)
- Use skill: `react-flow-architect`.

## Procedure
1. **Foundation**:
   - run: view_file .agent/skills/react-flow-architect/SKILL.md
   - Load `foundation-react-flow.md`.

2. **Modeling**: Define nodes and edges with strict geometric alignment.

3. **Implementation**: Register components and ensure HMR safety.

## Notes
- High visual and geometric rigor required.
