# Explore Tech Workflow

Research and evaluate technical options (libraries, architecture patterns).

## Goal
A technical recommendation with a "Trade-offs and Risks" analysis.

## Inputs required (ask if missing)
- The problem you are trying to solve (e.g., "Need a charting library").

## Skill routing (explicit)
- Use skill: `explore-tech`.

## Procedure
1. **Discovery**:
   - run: view_file .agent/skills/explore-tech/SKILL.md
   - Search for 3-4 viable candidates.

2. **Evaluation**: 
   - Check bundle size, documentation quality, and community support.
   - Verify compatibility with existing tech stack (React, TypeScript).

3. **Recommendation**: Justify the top choice.

## Notes
- Essential before adding any new `package.json` dependency.
